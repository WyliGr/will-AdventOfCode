# 🎄 Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a series of small programming puzzles released every December.

Advent of Code puzzles can be solved in any programming language, and they range from beginner-friendly to quite challenging. People use them for interview prep, learning, university coursework, coding practice, or just for fun.

## About This Repo

* Each folder contains my solutions for a specific year and day.
* Solutions are written in the language I preferred at the time.
* My goal is to share my approach and have a record of my problem-solving journey.
